        | Washington, D.C. takes first place on our list on the strength of having the most Bitcoin ATMs per capita anywhere in the country. There are 4.49 ATMs per million residents, and 2.39 establishments per million residents that accept Bitcoin as a form of payment.

        | With 62 establishments accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment statewide, New Hampshire has the most places per capita where you can use cryptocurrency to pay for retail purchases, food, and in some locations, travel and lodging. The state’s four Bitcoin ATMs work out to more than 3 per million residents, making New Hampshire one of the best equipped states for cryptocurrency transactions, even if the state’s residents are only about as interested as the national average.

        | With 24 Bitcoin ATMs available statewide, Georgia has the most locations where you can automatically convert cryptocurrency into cold hard cash. This is helpful for residents who own Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, as there are fewer retail and food establishments that accept Bitcoin than there are ATMs from which to withdraw funds.

        | Nevada is the first state on our list to have interest in cryptocurrency match infrastructure availability (sixth place). There are four Bitcoin ATMs available in the Las Vegas area, and a total of 78 other establishments that accept Bitcoin for payment, including real estate and legal firms, and one “Zombie Apocalypse Store.”

        | Like Nevada, Colorado residents are almost as interested in cryptocurrency as the infrastructure for use is available. Colorado is home to 90 establishments accepting Bitcoin payments and seven ATMs that are distributed throughout the Front Range region - not limited to the Denver metropolitan area. Here you can pay for wine and liquor, a lawyer, or a therapist, all in cryptocurrency.

        | Kansas is a rather surprising entry to our top ten states where you can spend cryptocurrency. Although the state has only one Bitcoin ATM, there are a whopping 110 establishments statewide that accept Bitcoin payments, 88 of which are restaurants. Nowhere else is it easier to order Chinese food and pay using Bitcoin.

        | New York comes in at seventh for availability of Bitcoin infrastructure, with a total of 23 ATMs statewide (20 of which are in New York City, plus Westchester and Nassau Counties, with the remaining three in the Capital Region). On this measure, New York trails only Georgia in absolute terms, while leading it in terms of the number of places where Bitcoin is accepted for payments. However, New York’s much larger population results in a lower ranking overall.

        | Eighth place Michigan would rank higher on our list if we were to go solely on its number of Bitcoin-enabled ATMs, with a total of 12 statewide. There are fewer establishments that accept Bitcoin payments on a per capita basis. On the other hand, there are few other states with multiple places where you can get cosmetic surgery and pay with cryptocurrency.

      p.rankings__item-text
        | At first glance, Missouri would appear to be an unlikely candidate for our top ten. However, like neighboring Kansas, Bitcoin payments are relatively widely accepted for restaurants and other food purchases. The state has more Bitcoin ATMs than Kansas, with five available statewide to Kansas’ one, but relatively fewer places to use cryptocurrencies for purchases.

        | Finally, we have Oregon rounding out our top ten list. While the state has only one Bitcoin ATM at present, there are a substantial number of retail, food/grocery, and other establishments accepting Bitcoin payments. Not surprisingly, there are at least seven alternative medicine practitioners in Oregon accepting cryptocurrency payments.
